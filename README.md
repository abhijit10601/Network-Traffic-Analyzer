# Network Traffic Analysis with Python

# Using Python to Analyze Network Traffic Activity:

Devices store activity logs containing communication details and file transfers.

Python can be used to analyze network traffic activity, enabling threat identification and damage assessment.

# Data Analysis with Python Libraries:

Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Networkx are used to read and graph network data.

Functions like groupby() and count() help analyze communication patterns and identify abnormal activity.

# Applying Graph Theory Using Networkx:

Networkx in Python is used to build node graphs representing communication between devices.

Color-coded maps can help identify suspicious devices and their communication patterns.

# Exploring Further Resources:

Recommended resources for understanding Graph Theory in Python and working with NetworkX documentation.

Articles on implementing Flask login, pagination using FastAPI, and form creation in Python Flask are also available.

# Diverse Applications of Python in Data Analysis:

Python can be used in various applications such as analyzing Powerball numbers and implementing the Flood Fill algorithm.
It also offers techniques for filtering rows and columns in Pandas for effective data analysis.
